## Known Issues
### Steam Engines
Currently, this mod does not support moving steam engines in the fashion described below. So If you have a steam engine on your interchange track, I advise you move it prior to the interchange being serviced, as there being a steam engine negates any checking this mod does. Note that it will stop moving cars upon the finding of a steam engine. So any cars that are in front of the steam engine will still be moved. This could cause the unwanted effect of no cars spawning on your interchange track, so again I advise you to move the steam engine from the interchange track before the interchange is serviced. This shouldn't really ever be an issue, unless you buy a steam engine right before your interchange gets serviced, which seems like a low probability. I hope to support moving steam engines in the future, but I did not want to wait to get this mod out just because of this limitation.

## FAQ
### What does this mod do?
 Currently in the game, If you have company owned cars in the interchange, they can and often do prevent interchange cars from spawning on the track they are on. This can be annoying in later stages of the game when you have a lot of interchange cars and have to wait for multiple interchange services in order to have all of your cars for the day. This mod simply looks for any company owned cars and disiel locomotives on the track and moves them to one end, coupled together. This allows interchange cars to be able to spawn on the track in situations where they normally wouldn't be able to.

### Does this work in Multiplayer?
Yes, only if the Host has the mod. Initial tests indicate that other players do not need the mod, even if they increment time to service the interchange. If the host does not have the mod, then it will not work.

### What version of Railroader does this mod work with?
2023.3.1
